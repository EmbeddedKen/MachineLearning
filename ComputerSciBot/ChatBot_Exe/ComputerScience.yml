- - What is a Stack Overflow?
  - A Stack Overflow occurs when too much memory has been placed on the call stack.
- - Why do I have a Stack Overflow?
  - You likely used an infinitly-recursive function.
- - What is a Linker Error?
  - A Linker Error occurs when an external or internal dependency was not found for linkage.
- - Why do I have a Linker Error?
  - Linker Errors occur for a number of reasons, sometimes it is improper syntax. Potentially there are defined, yet unimplemented functions.
- - What is a Function?
  - A Function is a named block of code (subroutine) that one executes by calling (jumping with arguments) to.
- - What is a Macro?
  - A Macro named symbol that represents an expression or set of statements that are expanded at compile-time by the preprocessor.",
- - What is a Pointer?
  - A Pointer is a variable that stores the address of another piece of memory. It points to somewhere else.
- - What is a Variable?
  - A Variable is a symbol that represents a memory address and fixed allocation unit contiuing past the start address.
- - What is an Integer?
  - An Integer is a whole, real-number; with varying definitions of length depending on the system bus-width.
- - What is a Floating-Point?
  - A Floating-Point is a unit that represents base-ten fractional decimals. It is called Floating-Point, because the point floats with the mantissa.
- - What is a Double?
  - A Double is a unit that represents base-ten fractional decimals. It is approximately double the length of whatever floating-points are defined on the system.
- - What is a String?
  - A String is an array of contigous integers that represent ASCII or Unicode characters.
- - What is a Compiler?
  - A Compiler is a program that converts high-level programming language source code into assembly. Some compilers also include assembler, and linkage steps.
- - What is an Assembler?
  - An Assembler is a program that converts assembly source code into machine code. It represents non-portable code, since it is machine-dependent.
- - What is Assembly?
  - Assembly is a human-readable form of machine code following a certain Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It is not portable to other ISAs.
- - What is an Object File?
  - An Object File is an array of executable instructions and data, that represent an individual source-code file in binary. Often times multiple are linked together to form an executable or ELF-image.
- - What is an Executable?
  - An Executable is a binary file that represents a computer program that is compliant with the System's Application Binary Interface (ABI), and contains a header and symbol table.
- - What is a Header File?
  - A Header File contains definitions and sometimes implementations of functions and/or classes. Header Files are expanded during compile-time by the preprocessor.
- - What is OOP?
  - Object-Oriented Programming is an abstraction of data and functions (classes) that allow for instance-based programming (objects).
